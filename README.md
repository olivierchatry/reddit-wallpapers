# reddit-wallpapers

This small nodejs application allows to download wallpapers, provide by imgur, from given subreddit. It use a configuration file that describe which subreditt to scan, and where to save the wallpapers. I'm not going to document to much on it, since it is for personal uses, but if you have question, do not hesitate.
